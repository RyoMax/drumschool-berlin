# **This is the new Website for the Drumschool-Berlin** 

The website is unfinished yet.

* note: at the moment the page is delivered via FTP transfer.
Switching the whole project to **node** will be a mandatory future project *

## **The major priorities are**

** Creating missing pages and key features  **
- Kontakt
- Probestunde
- fill in placeholder links with correct ones
- set up an automated email transfer

** Bugfixes  **
- the content height on the Unterricht pages should be similar to the devices
- the slash height on the same pages should be adjusted in the same way

## **SEO related tasks**

**Meta**
- create individual description for each main page
- figure out some key words, despite they might be ignored by google

**Pagespeed**
- minimize & compress:
* pictures to JPEG/webP
* css
* javascript
* html
- switch to html/2
- test on google pagespeed

**Else**
- check internal links

- add alternative descriptions to all pictures
- add sr-only into the "exit to lehrkr√§fte" link

## **Tidy up!**
